# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Apeiron! This guide explains the workflow for making changes to the engine.

## Overview

The contribution workflow has three stages:

1. **Implement** - Write your feature or fix
2. **Test** - Verify correctness with unit tests
3. **Validate** - Run SPRT if the change affects playing strength

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  Implement   │ --> │    Test      │ --> │    SPRT      │
│  Feature     │     │  (cargo)     │     │  (optional)  │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

## Step 1: Implement Your Change

### Types of Changes

| Change Type | Examples | Needs SPRT? |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Bug fix** | Crash fix, move generation error | Usually no |
| **Refactor** | Code cleanup, no behavior change | No |
| **Search improvement** | New pruning, better move ordering | **Yes** |
| **Evaluation change** | New eval term, tuned values | **Yes**, with the eval net retrained |
| **New feature** | New variant, new piece type | Depends |

### Code Style

- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` to catch common issues
- Write meaningful commit messages

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for issues
cargo clippy --lib
```

---

## Step 2: Run Tests

All changes must pass the existing test suite.

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all library tests
cargo test --lib

# Run with output shown
cargo test --lib -- --nocapture

# Run a specific test module
cargo test search::tests --lib
```

### Run Perft Tests

Perft validates that move generation is correct:

```bash
cargo test --test perft
```

### Check Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
cargo llvm-cov --lib

# Aim for >80% line coverage on modified files
```

---

## Step 3: SPRT Testing (For Logic Changes)

If your change affects search or evaluation, you **must** run SPRT to prove it doesn't weaken the engine.

### When to Run SPRT

Run SPRT for:
- ✅ Search algorithm changes (LMR, pruning, extensions)
- ✅ Evaluation term additions or modifications
- ✅ Move ordering improvements
- ✅ Time management changes

Skip SPRT for:
- ❌ Bug fixes (already broken behavior)
- ❌ Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- ❌ Documentation updates
- ❌ Test additions

### Running SPRT

1. **Build your baseline** (before changes):

```bash
# Save current state as "old" engine
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg-old
```

2. **Make your changes** and rebuild:

```bash
# This happens automatically when you run SPRT
```

3. **Run the SPRT test**:

```bash
cd sprt
npm run dev
```

4. **Open** `http://localhost:3000` and configure your test:
   - Use `all` preset for most changes
   - Mode: `Gainer` (proving improvement) or `Non-Regression` (proving no regression)

5. **Wait for result**:
   - ✅ **PASSED**: Your change is an improvement (or at least not worse)
   - ❌ **FAILED**: Your change weakens the engine
   - ⚠️ **INCONCLUSIVE**: Need more games or different bounds

See **[SPRT Documentation](../sprt/README.md)** for full details.

## Project Architecture

Understanding the codebase:

### Core Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lib.rs` | WASM bindings, Engine struct |
| `board.rs` | Piece types, coordinates, board representation |
| `game.rs` | GameState, make/undo moves, repetition detection |
| `moves.rs` | Legal move generation for all pieces |

### Search

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `search.rs` | Main iterative deepening + alpha-beta |
| `search/tt.rs` | Transposition table |
| `search/ordering.rs` | Move ordering heuristics |
| `search/see.rs` | Static exchange evaluation |

### Evaluation

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `evaluation/base.rs` | Core evaluation + piece-square logic |
| `evaluation/mop_up.rs` | Endgame evaluation for mating |
| `evaluation/insufficient_material.rs` | Draw detection |
| `evaluation/variants/*.rs` | Variant-specific evaluation |
| `eval_net/` | Learned residual on top of `base.rs` (training in `evalnet/`) |

### Utilities

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/bin/*.rs` | Standalone tools: Helpmate solver, SPSA tuner, debuggers (see **[src/bin/README.md](../src/bin/README.md)**) |

## Things to Know Before Proposing a Change

Measured, not opinions - re-testing needs new evidence:

- Derive behavior from the position, never the `[Variant]` tag.
- Narrowing history tables tends to win; widening tends to lose.
- Move ordering is near its practical ceiling (~91% first-move cutoff rate).
- Eval-term tweaks are extremely SPRT-fragile.
- The eval net is trained on the HCE's terms, so it must be retrained after any eval change before testing.

---

## Common Tasks

### Changing the Evaluation

The eval net's inputs are the HCE's own terms, so an eval change also changes what the net sees. The shipped net was fit to the old terms, so the new HCE needs its own net. Screen offline first; it takes minutes where an SPRT takes hours:

1. Make the change in `src/evaluation/base.rs` and add tests for it.
2. **Screen it.** Build `export_eval_features` from HEAD and from the change, run `evalnet/screen.sh` for both with the same seeds, and compare mean holdout losses (see `evalnet/README.md`). Use it to pick the best of several variants of an idea, and to drop a change only when it is clearly worse (about 1% or more); anything closer goes to SPRT. Small offline deficits have not predicted SPRT losses so far.
3. Re-export the full training data with the changed HCE, using the flags of the current net. Carry the depth-9 labels over with `--hash-out`/`--keep-hashes` and `evalnet/hash_labels.py`, since the change alters the feature keys.
4. Retrain the net on it with the current recipe, several seeds, and keep the best on the holdout.
5. SPRT the new HCE with its new net against HEAD as committed.
6. If it passes, commit the change together with its new `src/eval_net/eval_net.bin`.

### Adding a New Piece Type

1. Add the piece to `src/board.rs` (`PieceType` enum)
2. Add move generation in `src/moves.rs`
3. Add evaluation in `src/evaluation/base.rs`
4. Add tests for move generation and evaluation

### Tuning Parameters

Use SPSA for automatic parameter tuning:

```bash
cd sprt
npm run spsa -- --games 60 --iterations 100
```

See **[SPSA Documentation](../sprt/README.md#spsa-logic-tuning)**.
